"""
TODO 3-1: The BaseCommand class has a show_usage method implemented, but the execute method is not 
implemented and is passed on to the child class. Think about why this difference is made.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):
The show_usage method does the same job as printing description and usage for all subclasses. 
Whereas the execute method does the different job for each of subclasses.
So, there's no advantage for implementing the execute method. This method should be override anyway.


TODO 3-2: The update_current_path method of the BaseCommand class is slightly different from other methods. 
It has a @classmethod decorator and takes a cls argument instead of self. In Python, this is called a 
class method, and think about why it was implemented as a class method instead of a normal method.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):
The current_path is a variable defined in the Basecommand class and it does not initialize in a new 
iteration when main.py is executed. Therefore, by defining the `update_current_path` method as a class 
method, it allows for the new multiple instances of subclasses during the execution of iterations 
in main.py. These instances can access the modification of current_path through the `update_current_path`
method without depending on their instance state, but as a class state.
